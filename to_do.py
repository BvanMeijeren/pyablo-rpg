# Development roadmap

# Weapon swapping in inventory screen
# Spells selection window
# Enemy skill restriction
# Status effects
# Classes
# Encounters
# Inscryption-esque random road

# Story ideas

# start game off with typical medieval world, fight skeletons and golems, etc
# monsters turn out to be summons of cultist necromancers
# starter biome turns out to be cultist basement, you are escaping prisoner
# if player gathers more knowledge, they discover the cult that runs the world
# if player seeks more knowledge, insanity follow and hallucinations (fight hallucinations, turn out to be real people?)
# if player rejects the cult, they break the illusion and find the real world (fight cultist)
# psychological profiling: encounters where player can choose their path

# player is in the basement for cult recruitment, when he dies he is resurrected by necromancers
